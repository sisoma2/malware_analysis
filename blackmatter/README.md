# BlackMatter
In this repo you can find a small tool called `BlackMatter_hash.py` to recover the hashes hardcoded in different samples of the BlackMatter ransomware.

## Usage

In order to work it needs a file with the hashes each one in a different line and the dictionary with the processes to bruteforce with the same format.

```
python BlackMatter_hash.py -d HASHES_FILE -t DICTIONARY_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE
python BlackMatter_hash.py -m MODULE_NAME -a API_NAME
python BlackMatter_hash.py -s STRING
```

### File Format

The script will calculate the hash of every string in the dictionary file. 

Hashes can be prepend with 0x or not and they have to be in hexadecimal.

Lines starting with '#' will be ignored.

```
# Hashes file example
0xE99018C0
4c4b25d4

# Dict file example
$recycle.bin
```

## Example

```
python BlackMatter_hash.py -d dict.txt -t hashes.txt -o cracked.json
